The amount individuals get paid hourly affects their quality of life. To ensure that individuals experience a minimum quality of life, the federal government sets a minimum threshold of how much workers should get paid hourly.

Notice there has been significant changes since 1970; however, the Southern states of: Florida, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee still has a minimum wage of zero dollars. What was really surprising to me was that Arizona now has a state minimum wage of 0 dollars as well. Besides the states that was just mentioned, every state has increased their minimum wage in regards to what they believe was the minimum threshold to have a quality of life.\nFigure 4 depicts the difference between the federal and state minimum wage. A darker red shade represents a bigger negative difference between federal and state minimum wage. This indicates workers in that particular state are being underpaid according to what the federal government believes workers should be paid to have a minimum quality of life."

What is super surprising to me is that there are still certain states in the South that are not paying their workers a livable wage. The states of California, Washington, and the upper East Coast states are continually increasing their minimum wage to match what they believe will allow their residents to have a minimum quality of life. Notice how the states of Florida and Georgia have slightly increased their minimum wage, but certainly not enough where their residents and workers are able to have a quality of life. Figure 6 depicts the difference between the federal minimum wage and the federal minimum wage. Again, the majority of states in the Southern region are underpaying their workers. Even though there is a federal minimum, those particular states are not matching it. This affects the quality of life of the residents who reside in those states. There seems to be a half and half split of whether or not states are paying their workers a livable wage. The purple shades indicates particular states where they are paying their workers above the federal minimum wage. While the states shaded in red indicate that those states are under paying their workers.\n##Conclusion\nAlthough the minimum wage increased throughout the years in response to the minimum quality of life threshold; we have to realize that just because workers are being paid minimum wage that does not mean they have a decent quality of life. There are certain states where individuals are still not being paid enough."

Results_house includes information on the the number of districts a particular state has, whether a candidate from that district is from the Republican or Democratic Party, the general number of votes in the election. We begin with determining how many congressional candidates there are for each district in the United States.\n\nprint(results_house, width = Inf)\n\n# A tibble: 2,343 × 13\n   state district_id cand_id   incumbent party primary_votes primary_percent\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;lgl&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 AL    01          H2AL01077 TRUE      R             48702          0.555 \n 2 AL    01          H2AL01176 FALSE     R             21308          0.243 \n 3 AL    01          H2AL01184 FALSE     R             13809          0.158 \n 4 AL    01          H0AL01030 FALSE     R              3854          0.0440\n 5 AL    02          H0AL02087 TRUE      R                NA         NA     \n 6 AL    02          H2AL02141 FALSE     D                NA         NA     \n 7 AL    03          H2AL03032 TRUE      R                NA         NA     \n 8 AL    03          H2AL03099 FALSE     D                NA         NA     \n 9 AL    04          H6AL04098 TRUE      R                NA         NA     \n10 AL    04          H2AL04055 FALSE     D             10971          0.514 \n   runoff_votes runoff_percent general_votes general_percent won   footnotes\n          &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1           NA             NA        196374           0.979 TRUE  &lt;NA&gt;     \n 2           NA             NA            NA          NA     FALSE &lt;NA&gt;     \n 3           NA             NA            NA          NA     FALSE &lt;NA&gt;     \n 4           NA             NA            NA          NA     FALSE &lt;NA&gt;     \n 5           NA             NA        180591           0.636 TRUE  &lt;NA&gt;     \n 6           NA             NA        103092           0.363 FALSE &lt;NA&gt;     \n 7           NA             NA        175306           0.640 TRUE  &lt;NA&gt;     \n 8           NA             NA         98141           0.358 FALSE &lt;NA&gt;     \n 9           NA             NA        199071           0.740 TRUE  &lt;NA&gt;     \n10           NA             NA         69706           0.259 FALSE &lt;NA&gt;     \n# ℹ 2,333 more rows\n\nresults_house |&gt;\n  group_by(state, district_id) |&gt;\n  summarize(N = n())\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'state'.

Notice that we are not super interested in any Third Party candidates, but we are interested in knowing the proportion of Democratic and Republican votes.\n\nProportion of Republican and Democratic Votes\n\n# distribution of total number of votes is narrow by design\nwi_results |&gt;\n  skim(total_votes) |&gt;\n  select(-na)\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvar\nn\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\n\n\n\n\ntotal_votes\n8\n357795.9\n19345.37\n325321\n351227\n359322.5\n365871.5\n390111\n\n\n\n\n# compare total Dem and Rep votes across WI in 2012\nwi_results |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    N = n(), \n    state_votes = sum(total_votes), \n    state_d = sum(d_votes), \n    state_r = sum(r_votes)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    d_prop = state_d / state_votes, \n    r_prop = state_r / state_votes\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n      N state_votes state_d state_r d_prop r_prop\n  &lt;int&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     8     2862367 1445015 1401995  0.505  0.490\n\n\nFirst, we are interested in the mean of the total votes across all 8 congressional districts. Aproximately 357796 individuals from each congressional district voted, with a standard deviation of 19345. With that information, we are able to calculate the total amount of Republican and Democratic votes, and the proportion of Democratic and Republican votes for the entire state of Wisconsin.\n\n\nWinner of Each District\n\n# Proportion of Rep votes by district\nwi_results |&gt;\n  select(district, r_prop, winner) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(r_prop))\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  district r_prop winner    \n     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n1        5  0.679 Republican\n2        6  0.622 Republican\n3        7  0.561 Republican\n4        8  0.560 Republican\n5        1  0.549 Republican\n6        3  0.359 Democrat  \n7        2  0.320 Democrat  \n8        4  0.248 Democrat  \n\n\nNow, we are able to analyze the proportion of Republican voters, in addition, to the party that won in that congressional district. Notice, a bigger difference from 0.50 the better. For the state of Wisconsin, the Republican Party seems to have won in a majority of the congressional districts. However, notice that the Republican Party wins by a slight margin, whereas the Democratic Party won by a much alrger margin. In other words, there is a more significant difference between the Democratic and Republican votes. Now that we have the numbers, let us visualize the data."

From this map, I wanted to create a choropleth map which allows us to visualize the proportion of Republican and Democratic votes in each district.\n\nAnother visualization of our potential gerrymandering\n\n# Color based on proportion Rep.\nwi +\n  aes(fill = r_prop) + \n  scale_fill_distiller(\n    \"Proportion\\nRepublican\", \n    palette = \"RdBu\", \n    limits = c(0.2, 0.8)\n  )\n\nScale for fill is already present.\nAdding another scale for fill, which will replace the existing scale.\n\n\nWarning in st_point_on_surface.sfc(sf::st_zm(x)): st_point_on_surface may not\ngive correct results for longitude/latitude data\n\n\n\n\n# A leaflet map can allow us to zoom in and see where major cities fit, etc.\nlibrary(leaflet)\npal &lt;- colorNumeric(palette = \"RdBu\", domain = c(0, 1))\n\nleaflet_wi &lt;- leaflet(wi_merged) |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt;\n  addPolygons(\n    weight = 1, fillOpacity = 0.7, \n    color = ~pal(1 - r_prop),   # so red association with Reps\n    popup = ~paste(\"District\", DISTRICT, \"&lt;/br&gt;\", round(r_prop, 4))\n  ) |&gt;                          # popups show prop Republican\n  setView(lng = -89, lat = 44, zoom = 7)\nleaflet_wi\n\n\n\n\n\nNote, this is a choropleth map, where meaningful shading relates to the proportion of Democratic and Republican votes by congressional districts. Similar to the map above, the color blue represents the Democratic Party, while the color red represents the Republican Party. Notice, this map illustrates the same information as the map above. However, in this chorpleth map, we can how much each party won, by congressional districts. We can tell the proportion of Democratic and Republican votes by how opaic the colors are on the map. If we hover our mouse over a particular place on the map, it tells us what district it is, and the proportion of votes they received."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIt was quite interesting to explore the congressional districts data of Wisconsin. Knowing the results from the Presidential Election, I learned a lot about how the majority of the winning congressional districts does not translate to which party won in that particular state due to the electoral college. By analyzing potential gerrymandering data, we can learn more about each congressional district, and how the proportion of votes affect which party wins."
